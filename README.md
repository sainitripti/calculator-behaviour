# Calculate Behavior

This project works out five features of a calculator:

1. Addition
1. Multiplication
1. Division
1. Subtraction
1. Power-on and power-off

Each feature consists of scenarios as:

- initial condition (Given...)
- event (When...)
- effect (Then...)

Each feature is in a different markdown file.
